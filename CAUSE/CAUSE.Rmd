abstract: 
  According to the @causeofdeath, the top cause of death for US adults aged 1-54 is traffic accidents. Understanding more about what causes these accidents and how to prevent them is imperative to keeping vehicular operators and passengers safe. Our analysis uses public car crash data from the Iowa Department of Transportation. This data was collected from January 2009 until September 2022 and includes information about a variety of accident-related statistics. We focus on investigating the link between animal-related car accidents and daylight, specifically sunrise and sunset time. We also investigate the impacts of driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol on the severity of vehicular accidents. From our analysis, we find several links between sunrise/sunset times and crashes in Iowa. Furthermore, we were able to connect high rates of property damage and fatalities to the influence of drugs and alcohol. These findings can serve to better inform drivers and lawmakers who seek to improve road safety. We also present information about future research that may be done in the study area.

# Introduction

According to the @iowadot, there are over 50,000 crashes per year in Iowa alone. These crashes cause millions of dollars in property damage and, unfortunately, the loss of life, with over 300 people dying in vehicular crashes each year. It is important to gain a greater understanding of the causes of these crashes to better create prevention strategies and protect the drivers on the road. By informing drivers of potential hazardous practices, they will be better prepared and encouraged to follow safe driving practices. The goal of this report is to explore some of the relationship between crashes and driving conditions to gain a better understanding of how to make the road a safer place.

<!--# The Data-->

```

```{r data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Use this if the below code doesn't work - file must be stored on your device under the same folder.

crashes <- read_csv("https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/nathanrethwisch/Team-Pufferfish/main/Vehicle_Crashes_in_Iowa.csv")
```

The Iowa Department of Transportation collects data on every reported crash and makes this information publicly available at \url{https://icat.iowadot.gov/}. For each crash, a large number of variables is collected: date, time and location of the crash, the number of vehicles and passengers involved; crash severity measured in property damage, number of injuries, or fatalities; contributing factors such as weather and road conditions are reported, and whether any of the drivers were driving under the influence.

```{r wrangling, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

crashes$`City Name`[crashes$`City Name` == ""] <- NA
crashes$`County Name`[crashes$`County Name` == ""] <- NA
crashes$`Route with System`[crashes$`Route with System` == ""] <- NA

#Checking NA sums after we made changes to the dataset
colSums(is.na(crashes))

```

```{r wrangling2, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = FALSE}

             FALSE, sep = " ")

crashes<- crashes%>%mutate(Latitude = parse_number(Latitude), Longitude = parse_number(Longitude))
```

This report is based on crashes reported between Jan 1 2009 and the end of September 2022. 
Figure \@ref(fig:map) shows a map of all location of crashes in Iowa in 2021. We see that crashes happen everywhere, but there are certain highways and cities that contribute to higher numbers of crashes.

```{r map, fig.cap="Locations of all crashes in Iowa in 2021. Each crash is represented by a dot with an opacity of only 5\\% to provide an x-ray of high-density regions in the spatial distribution. Only when twenty crashes happen in the same location, do we see a fully saturated black dot on the map. The map paints a picture of Iowa's population centers and its network of roads."}

```

In our project we are interested in two of the biggest factors contributing to crashes: alcohol/drug involvement and crashes with animals. 
In section II we will present a short overview of the data and motivate our two lines of investigation. In section III we explore the relationship between car crashes and day light hours and demonstrate the underlying relationship  to crashes with animals. In section IV we close with a discussion of effects of alcohol involvement on crashes.
\vspace{-20pt}

# First overview

Between Jan 1 2009 and the end of September in 2022 a total of 728,442 crashes in Iowa were reported. Figure \@ref(fig:avgcrashes) shows the average number of crashes in Iowa by day of the year. We see that during spring and summer months there are  fewer crashes (on average about 15% fewer) than during the rest of the year. Besides better weather during the summer months, more daylight hours provide better lighting conditions for drivers (see also section III C). From November to February, we see an increased variability in the number of crashes -- this is likely due to bad weather days with large number of crashes in some of the years.  There is a clear holiday effect in the number of crashes: New Year's day, the Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, Christmas day and the day after have a much-reduced number of crashes. However, both New Year's day and the Fourth of July have a very large number of drunk crashes in comparison to the rest of the year (shown in orange).  On New Year's day  almost triple the number of drug-involved crashes happen compared to  any regular day of the year. We will further investigate the relationship between alcohol and crashes in section IV.

````{=html}
<!--Finally, I looked at crashes by day of the year. There is no real pattern in by day of the year, but there are a few outliers. Both New Year's day and the Fourth of July have a very large amount of drunk crashes in comparison to the rest of the year. This first graph shows all drug-related crashes:

```{r, eval=FALSE, results = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Plot of crashes with drug usage by day of the year
c %>%
  filter(Drug_Usage == TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Day)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~Month)
# No real pattern except for two huge outliers, New Year's Day and the Fourth of # July
```

  mutate(Drug_Usage = 
           (`Drug or Alcohol` != "None Indicated") &
           (`Drug or Alcohol` != "Refused")) %>%

    axis.text.y.right = element_text(color = "darkorange")
  )
```

Figure \@ref(fig:daytime) shows bar charts of the average number of car crashes by hour over the course of a day throughout the months of the year. Initially, we see two prominent peaks in the number of crashes around the times of morning and evening commutes. However, in late spring a third peak appears at a later time that only disappears by September and merges to a single huge peak with the evening commuting time in November. Looking at crashes involving animals we see that this third peak is strongly correlated with the time that animals are hit in the evening. We look at this phenomenon more closely in section III.

```{r daytime, fig.cap="Average number of crashes by hour of the day and month of the year. Crashes involving animal hits are shown in orange.", fig.height = 6,  out.width="\\columnwidth"}
animals <- crashes %>% filter(`Major Cause`=="Animal") %>% group_by(Year, Month, Hour) %>% count() %>% 
  ungroup(Year) %>% summarize(avg=mean(n))

```

# Sunrise/Sunset Analysis

The initial data overview uncovered a potential connection between animal-related crashes and the dawn and dusk hours. In this section we dig deeper into this idea to investigate the potential causes of the two daily spikes in animal-related crashes.

## Data Extraction

While the time of day controls human behavior,  sunrise and sunset regulate daily routines of animals. Times of sunrise and sunset depend on one's location and the time of the year. Light conditions, such as dusk and dawn, are included as part of the accident report, however their change over time made it hard for us to come to a single conclusion. We therefore thought it more appropriate for an anlysis to transform the time of an accident with respect to when the sun is rising and setting. Sunset and sunrise times were not included in the accident report. As an alternative data source we used the data portal by @timeanddate. Figure \@ref(fig:timeanddate) shows an example of the available data for the first week of March 2020 for Ames, IA. Rather than scraping all locations over time, we focused only on Ames. Ames is Iowa's major town closest to the state's geographical center. Making Ames the reference point limits the variation of sunrise and sunset times based on location. For approximately every 70 miles, there is a one-minute change in sunrise and sunset times. By using Ames, these discrepancies are limited to under three minutes. We chose to scrape data for 2020 because it is the most recent leap year and therefore provides data for February 29th (see appendix for details). 


```{r timeanddate, fig.cap="Example of  data on  sunrise and sunset times provided by timeanddate.com."}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/paste-5719206D.png")
```

```{r load_sun}
if (!file.exists("../data/ames-sunset-sunrise-2020.csv")) source("../code/timeanddata-scrape.R")

sun <- read_csv("../data/ames-sunset-sunrise-2020.csv")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = FALSE}
crashes$Month<- gsub("Month ", "\\1", crashes$Month)
crashes$Month<- parse_integer(crashes$Month)

crashes$Day <- sub("^0+", "", crashes$Day)       
crashes$Day<- parse_integer(crashes$Day)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = FALSE}
#I needed to convert the Date back to integer so I could join with original data
sun$Date <- as.integer(sun$Date)
  
#Joining the original data and scraped data by day and month
df<- left_join(crashes, sun, by = c("Day" = "Date", "Month" = "Month"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = FALSE}
#Finding the difference between the sunset time and the time of the crash
df$sunsetDiff = difftime(df$`Time of Crash`, df$`Sunset Time`, unit = 'mins')
df$sunriseDiff = difftime(df$`Time of Crash`, df$`Sunrise Time`, unit = 'mins')
df$sunDiff <- with(df,pmin(abs(sunsetDiff), abs(sunriseDiff)))

```

## Sunrise/Sunset Analysis

```{r sunrise, results = FALSE, echo= FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="All crashes shown by the difference between crash time and sunrise."}
#A graph of all crashes by the difference between crash time and sunrise
duskdawn <- df %>% filter(`Light Conditions` %in% c("Dusk", "Dawn"))

sunr<- df%>%
  filter(`Major Cause` == "Animal")%>%
  group_by(sunriseDiff)%>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sunriseDiff, y = n)) + 
#  geom_jitter(aes(y=150), alpha = 0.05, size = 5, colour = "#4e5481", data = duskdawn %>% sample_n(3000), width=0, height =150) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, colour = "grey20") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -23, colour = "grey20", linetype=2) +
  geom_point(size=2, shape=21, stroke = 0.25, fill="grey30",
             color = "grey80") +ylab("Number of Crashes") +  
  ggtitle("Number of Animal Crashes\n by distance (in min) from Sunrise Time") + 
  scale_x_continuous("Minutes From Sunrise", 
    limits = c(-250,250), breaks=c(-250, -125,-23,  125, 250))
```

Sunrise and sunset times are incorporated into the crash records and allow us to calculate for each crash the distance in minutes from sunset or sunrise. Figure \@ref(fig:sunTime) gives an overview of the number of animal-related crashes in Iowa given time from sunrise (left) and time from sunset (right).
The vertical lines denote the time of sunrise and sunset. The hashed lines are drawn through the times when animal hits spike. There is a gradual increase in the crashes beginning approximately 100 minutes before the sun rises. Once the sun is up, the number of animal-related crashes reduces drastically. <!--One explanation for this is that an increased number of drivers are on the road during the rush hour which often falls just before sunrise. Due to low visibility which decreases reaction time, drivers may be more likely to cause a vehicular accident.-->

The plot on the right of Figure \@ref(fig:sunTime) shows the reverse phenomenon - crashes start to spike *after* the sun has set. According to the @duskdawn, driving at dusk is extremely dangerous, as one's eyes take time to adjust to the relative darkness, shadows hide animals and road features, and driver sometimes fail to turn on their headlights. This may be a reason why there is such a strong correlation between sunset time and a spike in car crashes.

```{r sunset, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap="All crashes shown by the difference between crash time and sunset"}
#A graph of all crashes by the difference between crash time and sunset

suns<- df%>%
  filter(`Major Cause` == "Animal")%>%
  group_by(sunsetDiff)%>%
  summarise(n = n())%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sunsetDiff, y = n)) + 
#  geom_jitter(aes(y=275), alpha = 0.05, size = 5, colour = "#4e5481", data = duskdawn %>% filter(`Light Conditions`=="Dusk") %>% sample_n(2500), width=0, height =275) +

  geom_vline(xintercept = 37, colour = "grey30", linetype=2) +

             color = "grey80") +ylab("Number of Crashes") +  
  ggtitle("\nby distance (in min) from Sunset Time") + 
  scale_x_continuous("Minutes From Sunset", 
    limits = c(-250,250), breaks=c(-250, -125, 0, 37, 125, 250))
```

```{r sunTime, dependson="sunset", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "A comparison of animal-related crashes with minutes away from sunrise (left) and minutes away from sunset (right)", fig.height=4, out.width='\\columnwidth'}
grid.arrange(sunr, suns, ncol = 2) 
```


## Daylight Analysis

Figure \@ref(fig:daylight) shows a summary of the average number of crashes by day by thelength of the day measured in daylight hours. A LOESS (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing) fit is added as a line to the scatterplot to summarize the relationship between length of day and the number of car crashes.

```{r daylight, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Crashes by length of the day, with a line fit using LOESS smoothing"}
daylight <- df%>%
  mutate(yday = lubridate::yday(`Date of Crash`), 
         dm = paste(lubridate::month(`Date of Crash`, abbr=TRUE, label = TRUE),Day, sep=" ")) %>%
  group_by(yday, Month, dm, Year) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), Daylight=mean(Daylight), dm = dm[1]) %>%
  ungroup() %>% group_by(yday) %>%
  summarize(n = mean(n), Daylight=mean(round(Daylight)), Month=Month[1], dm = dm[1]) 
daylight %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Daylight, y = n)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = factor(Month))) + 
  ylab("Number of Crashes") + 
  geom_smooth(span = 0.75, linewidth=.75, se=FALSE, colour = "black") +
  scale_x_time() +
  geom_text(aes(label= dm), data = daylight %>% filter(n < 120, Daylight < 34000), nudge_x = 1500, color="grey50", size = 2.5) +
  scale_colour_viridis_d("Month")
```

While there is more variability in earlier months (as seen before in Figure \@ref(fig:avgcrashes)), there is a very clear  downward trend, showing that the average number of crashes decreases with more daylight. However, for the long summer days we see an increase in the number of crashes again -- most likely due to the additional opportunities that longer days provide. 
<!--there is a correlation to fewer daylight hours and more crashes. This is likely due to colder weather causing poor road conditions in the winter months, as well as an increase in drivers during dusk and dawn. As previously noted, dusk and dawn prove to be some of the most dangerous times to drive.-->
<!--The difference in the average number of crashes in March compared to September is interesting: while the amount of daylight hours is about the same (around 12 hours), there are on average fewer crashes in March than in September.  -->

# Alcohol Analysis

For the next part of our analysis, we are looking into the relationship between alcohol/drug usage and car crashes. The initial overview showed that certain days of the year have significant spikes in alcohol-related accidents. Our exploration focuses on the difference alcohol use makes compared to driving sober.

```{r, results = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Creates new data set to do modifications on
crash <- crashes

# Changes the drug or alcohol column to a factor so that all the levels can be
# found
crash$`Drug or Alcohol` <- as.factor(crash$`Drug or Alcohol`)

# Finds the levels of the column
levels(crash$`Drug or Alcohol`)

crash %>%
  filter( (`Drug or Alcohol` == "None Indicated") | (`Drug or Alcohol` == "Refused")) %>%
  select(`Drug or Alcohol`)

# Creates new column that combines all the levels of substance abuse
crash <- crash %>%
  mutate(Drug_Usage = 
           (`Drug or Alcohol` != "None Indicated") &
           (`Drug or Alcohol` != "Refused"))

```

```{r, results = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Total number of crashes without substance abuse
(false_rows <- crash %>%
  filter(Drug_Usage == FALSE) %>%
  select(`Amount of Property Damage`) %>%
  nrow())

# Total amount of crashes with substance abuse
(true_rows <- nrow(crash) - false_rows)
```

## Property Damage

Although crashes involving drunk drivers are less common, they cause about 45\% or \$3000 more damage on average.
<!--Figure \@ref(fig:property)shows the difference in property damage between drunk and sober crashes.-->

```{r, results = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Total cost of crashes without substance abuse
(false_total_cost <- crash %>%
  filter(Drug_Usage == FALSE) %>%
  select(`Amount of Property Damage`) %>%
  sum(na.rm=TRUE))

# Total cost of crashes with substance abuse
(true_total_cost <- crash %>%
  filter(Drug_Usage == TRUE) %>%
  select(`Amount of Property Damage`) %>%
  sum(na.rm=TRUE))
  
# Average property damage of crash without substance abuse
avg_Sober<- false_total_cost / false_rows

# Average property damage of crash with substance abuse
avg_Drunk <- true_total_cost / true_rows

avg_Sober<- format(round(avg_Sober, 2), nsmall = 2)
avg_Drunk <- format(round(avg_Drunk, 2), nsmall = 2)


```

```{r property, eval=FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "A plot of the difference between average property damage among sober drivers and drivers under the influence of drugs and alcohol"}
dat <- paste0("$", c(avg_Sober, avg_Drunk))


crash %>%
  group_by(Drug_Usage) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(`Amount of Property Damage`,na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Drug_Usage, y=mean, fill = Drug_Usage)) + 
  geom_col() + xlab("Alcohol Usage") + ylab("Average Property Damage") +
  ggtitle("Average Property Damage by Alcohol Usage") + scale_x_discrete(labels=c("No Drugs Present", "Drugs Present"))+ geom_text(aes(label = dat), vjust = -0.2) + scale_fill_discrete("Drug Usage", 
                      labels=c("No Drugs Present", "Drugs/Alcohol Present"))
```

We also looked into the average number of fatalities with and without the use of alcohol. While sober, 1 in 127 crashes (0.79%) result in a fatality. However, when drugs or alcohol are present, fatalities happen in 1 of every 20 crashes (5%). The presence of drugs and alcohol leads to an unprecedented rise in fatality rate.

```{r, results = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Total number of fatalities with and without substance abuse
(false_total_fatal <- crash %>%
  filter(Drug_Usage == FALSE) %>%
  select(`Number of Fatalities`) %>%
  sum(na.rm=TRUE))

(true_total_fatal <- crash %>%
  filter(Drug_Usage == TRUE) %>%
  select(`Number of Fatalities`) %>%
  sum(na.rm=TRUE))

# Average fatalities per accident without substance abuse
false_total_fatal / false_rows

# Average fatalities per accident with substance abuse
true_total_fatal / true_rows

```

```{r, results = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
crash <- crash %>%
  mutate(Hour = parse_number(Hour))

byhour <- crash %>% group_by(Hour, Year) %>% tally() %>%
  summarize(avg = mean(n))

byhour_alc <- crash %>% filter(Drug_Usage == TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(Hour, Year) %>% tally() %>%
  summarize(avg = mean(n))

# Plot of all crashes by the hour
gg1<- byhour %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Hour, y = avg)) + 
  geom_bar(fill="grey50", stat="identity") + 
  ggtitle("All crashes") + ylab("Average number of crashes")
# Most crashes happen during "rush hour" from 4 to 6 P.M.

# Plot of all crashes with sustance abuse by the hour
gg2<- byhour_alc %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Hour, y = avg)) + 
  geom_bar(fill="darkorange", stat="identity")+ 
  ggtitle("Crashes involving drunk drivers") + ylab("Average number of crashes")
# Most crashes with substances involved happen from 11 P.M. to 3 A.M.

```

## Hour of the Day and Day of the Week

Figure \@ref(fig:crashHour) (left) shows the familiar pattern on average number of crashes by the hour of the day. 
This pattern changes considerably when one of the drivers is drunk. Most DUI crashes happen at night between 11 pm and 3 am.

```{r crashHour, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Crashes by hour shown across all drivers (left) and inebriated drivers (right)", fig.height=3.5}
grid.arrange(gg1, gg2, ncol = 2)
```

```{r, results = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Contains only crashes occuring between 10 P.M. and 4 A.M.
c_night <- crash %>%
  filter(Hour >= 22 | Hour <= 4)

# Total number of night crashes
(total_night <- nrow(c_night))

# Total number of crashes with drug usage during the night
(true_total_night <- c_night %>%
  filter(Drug_Usage == TRUE) %>%
  nrow())
```

```{r, results = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Crashes with substances are 4% of all crashes
true_rows / nrow(crash)

# Crashes with substances are 14% of all crashes from 10 P.M. to 3 A.M.
true_total_night / total_night

```

Figure \@ref(fig:crashDay) shows the aveage number of crashes by day of the week (in grey) and compares that to the number of crashes under the influence of drugs (in orange).

```{r crashDay, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap= "Average number of crashes by day of the week (grey). The subset of drunk crashes is shown in orange. Note that drunk crashes are shown on a different scale to emphasize the weekly pattern. "}
#grid.arrange(w1, w2, ncol = 2)
w3
```

Fridays are on average the day with the highest number of car crashes. One explanation for this is that more people are on the road due to weekend travel. However, DUI crashes happen more often by far on Saturdays and Sundays. This is likely due to drinking on Friday and Saturday night which leads to crashes early on Saturday and Sunday morning.

```{r, eval = FALSE, results = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Plot of crashes by days in January
crash %>%
  filter(Month == 1) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Day)) + geom_bar()
# New Year's Day actually has the least amount of crashes in January, but the
# most amount of drunk crashes
```

# Conclusion

Based on our data, we found sufficient evidence that  dawn and dusk hours cause a significant increase in animal-related crashes due to increased animal activity, the adjustment of driver's eyes, and failure to adequately turn on headlights. We also found that alcohol and drugs significantly impair a driver's ability, leading to a drastic increase in fatalities and property damage. These crashes are concentrated at night and during the weekends.

From these findings, we recommend that drivers be further informed about the dangers of driving immediately after sunset. Furthermore, vehicle manufacturers can take precautions to ensure lights turn on at a certain darkness level. Our analysis also supports ongoing efforts to educate drivers about the dangers of driving while intoxicated. Those efforts should be continued as they are important to keeping the roads safe.

Some limitations of our analysis include the lack of exact positional data for all sunrise and sunset times. Although we reduced variability in our model as much as possible, we did not account for changes in elevation, and differences location can account for up to three minutes of error when analyzing sunset and sunrise times.

Regardless, these limitations provide minimal challenges to the results of our findings. We would however, recommend an analysis of rush hour traffic and its effect on the prevalence of vehicular accidents. Overall, our findings may motivate drug and alcohol prevention programs, as well as inform research into safety measures that can be applied to mitigate the adverse effects of dusk driving.

## Data Cleaning/Processing

Data cleaning included changing empty strings and illogical values into NA values. Day, month, and year values were extracted using R's lubridate package. Latitude and longitude columns were also created from the 'Position' column to further explore where crashes happen in Iowa.

Information scraped from @timeanddate included hours of daylight, sunrise and sunset time, and date. Each month of the year was contained in a separate url which was a challenge of scraping the data. Furthermore, conditional cases of time changes presented additional challenges.

The main data set has a variable titled "Drug or Alcohol" with eight different levels. However, only two of these levels signify that substances were not involved. Because of this, we created a helper variable titled "Drug_Usage" that is TRUE when there are substances involved and FALSE when there is none present.
